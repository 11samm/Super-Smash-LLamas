# Super Smash LLamas
Super Smash Llamas is a fast-paced multiplayer game where up to 16 players compete to be the last one standing on one of six unique maps. The game features dynamic gameplay with randomly assigned weapons and periodic ability spawns.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Map & Weapon Rotation:
 Players spawn on one of six maps with a random weapon that switches every 16 seconds.

### Ability Spawns:
 Every 30 seconds, abilities appear in the center of the map to provide players with strategic advantages.

### Health System:
 Players have two types of health:

* True Health:
 This is the player's actual health that decreases when they take damage.

* Shield:
 When players are hit, their shield is depleted first, increasing their knockback value.

### Knockback Mechanic:
 As players take damage, their knockback value increases, leading to elimination when knocked off the map.

### Closing Border:
 A border shrinks over time, inflicting damage over time to true health if players venture beyond it.
